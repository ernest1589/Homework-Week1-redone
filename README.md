# <Homework Week 1>

- The motivation to create this proyect is to put in practice what we learn through the first 3 clases of this Bootcamp.
- I build this proyect to test my knowledge, to see how much of what i was able to get and I am able to show.
- Solves the challenge of building something fro scratch and make sure I am able to take care of each detail.
- I learn the structure of a basic code, how important it is to pay attention on every class, spelling and make sure every detail is the same when you want changes to be reflected on diferent partos of the web.

## How to access
-The only step required for you to have access is to click on the link for you to open the web page created.
## Usage
The only purpose of the creation of this web page is to showwhat was learned during the first week, has no specific purpose. Here are a couple of screenshots of how the webpage looks
